## Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I come from a background in Data Analytics and have extensive skills in tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau and Excel.
I have a strong passion for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and love coming up actionable insights to help support data-driven solutions.
Based off of the data I find I can also develop dashboards to help present my findings for business needs.

Please feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if I seem like a desired fit.
