### Dashboard Features

1. **Orders Analysis** – Track order volumes, item categories, and delivery locations.

2. **Ingredient Utilization** – Measure recipe-level ingredient demand and cost.

3. **Inventory Tracking** – Compare ordered ingredient quantities vs. available stock.

4. **Labour Costs** – Calculate staff hours and wage expenses per shift.

5. **Profitability Metrics** – Assess food and labour costs to identify high-margin and low-margin items.
